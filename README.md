## ðŸ“Œ Summary

Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used to summarize information retrieved from multiple sources, but they often obscure the value contributed by each document. Our paper proposes **Cluster Shapley**, an efficient Shapley value approximation algorithm that clusters documents based on LLM-based semantic similarity. This method enables fair and scalable attribution of document contributions in LLM-generated summaries.

## ðŸ“‚ Code Availability

The implementation of the Cluster Shapley algorithm, along with data processing and evaluation scripts, will be released here soon.
