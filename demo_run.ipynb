Those negative reviews are coming from customers who don’t know how to read and follow simple instructions. It literally doesn’t get any easier. You choose which type of gift card (in this case, Playstation). Then you choose the amount (ranging from $10, $25, $50, or $100). You pay for the digital gift card. Then you check your email for a confirmation of your order. Within that very email, you should receive the redeem code for the gift card. It literally doesn’t get any easier than that. In the case you do have a problem with the redeem code, simply contact Amazon customer service and they will guide you through a new one.   \n",

You can save a penny every time you buy online. May be trivial to some, but every penny does count. I'm also in the same boat like some other reviewers. The PSN store stopped accepting my credit card for whatever reason. It was impossible to get it to work. I didn't want to wait a week for it to arrive in the mail, but amazon started doing this years ago and THANK YOU!It comes in about 2 min into your email account. I'm also overseas working, so this was a real life saver. Now if Sony would only fix their system to accept my card! But I guess it's better to do it this way and have a budget on what I'm buying. Anyway, great service and great price.   \n",

First call, smaller told us to YouTube how to access our code, then provided us with a Google link to a search with misspelled words and eventually told us that we needed to install Amazon on our PS4 and after loging I. From the PS4, our digital code would automatically work. The support person said he was with Sony and not Amazon, however they emailed from an amazing email account. Took several calls and several days to obtain the digital code. I do not recommend purchasing from here.   \n",

Apparently I have purchased them a total of 51 times now... Wow! Unfortunately I can never find this small of an amount at any of the local stores who only seem to carry amounts of $25 or more. Within a minute or two of ordering this gift card on amazon I'm sent an email with the code, my son enters it on his Playstation account and we're done. I like that it's all digital too and that there is no waste for the trash can. I've not had a problem yet receiving any of the codes and if you don't see it in your email you can always find it under the \"Digital content and devices\" section and then clicking on \"Digital games and software.\"   \n",

You can simply by this card on Amazon, or even at your local CVS with cash (even more secure) and redeem the code in the Playstation Store without sharing your credit card number. This fills your Playstation Store wallet while keeping your card number hidden from a network that seems to have a lot of enemies these days.I started using these gift cards a few years ago when the credit card numbers of Playstation Members were compromised and I was forced to change my credit card.I recommend this card for people who may want to remove their credit card number from the PSN servers.   \n",

I wanted to send these as an Easter gift to my grandkids, who are teens and it was easy as pie.  First I purchased one as a test.  The code came through right away.  There may be another way to send them but I did a screenshot and forwarded it to my grandson.  The second purchase was also easy but took about 3 mins to come through.  I also did a screen shot and forwarded it to my other grandson.  At one point I tried to open it with my Sony account when I clicked too many times but since I don't have an account, it didn't work.  I backtracked and went to the code and it worked.  I recommend these for times when you can't make a personal visit to someone.  I plan to purchase again in the future.   \n",

It only gets worse.  Says \"processing\".  The car was ordered before 4 PM, it is now after midnight and the card says still processing. Disappointing my grandchildren is not something I'm going to reward this company for. One thing is for certain and two is for sure, I will NEVER spend another dime with PlayStation and I am that Granny that gets a card every single time one of the grands ask, I usually run out an buy them. Guess I'll have to have them pick something else to have me spend my money on because not another dime will be spent with them. Run me my money back NOW PlayStation, this is ridiculous!   \n",
